A low-level, asynchronous HTTP client protocol implementation for [wreq].

## Features

- Client-side [HTTP/1](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html) and [HTTP/2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html) implementations.
- Streaming bodies and trailers with backpressure.
- [HTTP Upgrade](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-upgrade) and [CONNECT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-connect) tunnels, including [HTTP/2 Extended CONNECT](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8441.html).
- Pluggable executors and timers, with Tokio and Compio runtime adapters.
- Optional tracing with no default Cargo features.
- Tested against [Hyper] servers.

## Usage

Add the protocol crate to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wreq-proto = "0.2"
```

The client APIs are organized by protocol:

```rust
use wreq_proto::conn::{http1, http2};

fn main() {
    // ...
}
```
